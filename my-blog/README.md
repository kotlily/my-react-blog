# Getting Started with Create React App

### Install Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en

Once Node.js is installed, test that it works:  
node -v

npm -v 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npx create-react-app my-blog`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
But for this specific app to be able to start, you need to export REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY env var
```
$ export REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<key> && npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Installing Dependencies/Packages

### DOM Router
`npm istall react-router-dom`  # For routing

`npm install axios`  # library to be able to communicate via REST between front and back end

`npm install http-proxy-middleware`  # in order to communicate 

`npm install firebase`  # For authentication and authorization


## Proxy setup for testing on the same server

Create setupProxy.js file in a way that it will make sure that all /api calls from the browser are redirected to a backend service. <br>
Then when you use axios library to make calls, you will not need to provide a full url, just /api/...
```axios.get(`/api/articles/${articleId}`, { headers });```
